# Maptime PDX HTML & CSS Basics

Maptime is primarily about mapping, but before getting into things like webmapping APIs, I think it's beneficial to have at least a cursory foundation in web programming.

## What This __Is__

__Some__ of the fundamentals to help introduce you to the syntaxes (syntacti?) of HTML & CSS. The goal is to just barely get your feet wet and, hopefully, get you hungry to do more.

## What This __Is Not__

This is __not__ a comprehensive guide to all things HTML & CSS. You __will__ have questions. That's ok. A big part of _all_ kinds of coding is taking what you know and building upon it. That often means research and collaborating with others. Thankfully there are a __plethora__ of resources on the internet and here in Portland.
